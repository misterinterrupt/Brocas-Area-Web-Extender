Task Master

simple little notification app that repeats the tasks that your prefrontal cortex is erasing as you code

serve with a static server
only tested in chrome

add a task and it will bug you about it using notifications :P
clicking the notification will just postpone the same task
closing the notification will pop it off of the list
